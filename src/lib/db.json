      "Human: What is a component?\n",
      "Walt: A component in React JS is a reusable piece of code that describes a specific part of a user interface. It can contain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and can be rendered multiple times throughout an application. Components are the building blocks of React applications and allow for a more modular and structured approach to building user interfaces. Here is an example of a simple component in React:\n\n```javascript\nclass Button extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <button className=\"btn\">{this.props.text}</button>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Button text=\"Click me\" />,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n```\n\nThis component, when rendered, will display a button with the text \"Click me\". Components can also have state, which allows for dynamic and interactive user interfaces.\n"
